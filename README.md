# Biomedical Data Analysis

## Description
In this project I work through the problems sets in the textbook [Data Analysis for Life Sciences](https://leanpub.com/dataanalysisforthelifesciences/) by Rafael A Irizarry and Michael I Love.

This textbook is used as the text for the XSeries [Data Analysis for Life Sciences](https://www.edx.org/xseries/data-analysis-life-sciences) that was created by [Harvard University](https://www.edx.org/school/harvardx) on the [edX](https://www.edx.org/) platform.

An online version of the textbook is available at [PH525x series - Biomedical Data Science](http://genomicsclass.github.io/book/).
