# Biomedical Data Analysis

## Description
In this project I work through the problems sets in the textbook [Data Analysis for Life Sciences](https://leanpub.com/dataanalysisforthelifesciences/) by Rafael A Irizarry and Michael I Love.

This textbook is used as the text for an XSeries that was created by Harvard University on [edX](https://www.edx.org/0). 

An online version of the textbook is available at [PH525x series - Biomedical Data Science](http://genomicsclass.github.io/book/).
