# Suppose we are interested in the proportion of times we see a 6 when rolling n=100 die. 
# This is a random variable which we can simulate with x=sample(1:6, n, replace=TRUE) 
# and the proportion we are interested in can be expressed as an average: mean(x==6). 
# Because the die rolls are independent, the CLT applies.
# We want to roll n dice 10,000 times and keep these proportions. 

# This random variable (proportion of 6s) has mean p=1/6 and variance p*(1-p)/n. 
# So according to CLT z = (mean(x==6) - p) / sqrt(p*(1-p)/n) should be normal with mean 0 and SD 1. 
# Set the seed to 1, then use replicate to perform the simulation, 
# and report what proportion of times z was larger than 2 in absolute value (CLT says it should be about 0.05).

# For the last simulation you can make a qqplot to confirm the normal approximation. 
# Now, the CLT is an asympototic result, meaning it is closer and closer to being a perfect 
# approximation as the sample size increases. 
# In practice, however, we need to decide if it is appropriate for actual sample sizes. Is 10 enough? 15? 30?
# 
# In the example used in exercise 1, the original data is binary (either 6 or not). 
# In this case, the success probability also affects the appropriateness of the CLT. 
# With very low probabilities, we need larger sample sizes for the CLT to "kick in".

# As we have already seen, the CLT also applies to averages of quantitative data. 
# A major difference with binary data, for which we know the variance is
# p(1 - p), is that with quantitative data we need to estimate the population standard deviation.
# 
# In several previous exercises we have illustrated statistical concepts with the unrealistic situation 
# of having access to the entire population. In practice, we do *not* have access to entire populations. 
# Instead, we obtain one random sample and need to reach conclusions analyzing that data. 
# dat is an example of a typical simple dataset representing just one sample. 
# We have 12 measurements for each of two populations:
#   
# X <- filter(dat, Diet=="chow") %>% select(Bodyweight) %>% unlist
# Y <- filter(dat, Diet=="hf") %>% select(Bodyweight) %>% unlist
# 
# We think of X as a random sample from the population of all mice in the control diet and
# Y as a random sample from the population of all mice in the high fat diet.
# 
# Define the parameter mu_X as the average of the control population. 
# We estimate this parameter with the sample average . What is the sample average?

# We don't know mu_x, but want to use X_bar to understand mu_X.

# 5. The result above tells us the distribution of the following random variable: 
# Z = sqrt(12)*(X_bar - mu_X)/sigma_X.
# What does the CLT tell us is the mean of Z (you donâ€™t need code)?
# mean of 0

#6
# The result of 4 and 5 tell us that we know the distribution of the difference between 
# our estimate and what we want to estimate, but don't know. 
# However, the equation involves the population standard deviation sigma_X, which we don't know. 
# Given what we discussed, what is your estimate of sigma_X?

# tstat <- abs( mean(X) - mean(Y) ) / se; p-val <- pt( tstat, df=22 ) * 2; 
# if the df=22 above was replaced by 20.236, 
# i.e. pt(tstat, df=20.236)*2 we got the same p-value of 0.05299888.
